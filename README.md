This crate started as a knock-off of the [secret-service](https://crates.io/crates/secret-service) crate, which uses [zbus](https://crates.io/crates/zbus) to access the secret service. The basic collection, item and search APIs in this crate are meant to work the same as the blocking APIs in the zbus-based crate. If they don't, please file a bug.

Why do a knock-off? So that folks who write synchronous Rust apps that access the secret service (for example, [Keyring](https://open-source-cooperative/keyring-rs/wiki/Keyring) clients) are not required to add an async runtime. Because this knock-off uses lib-dbus, it doesn't require an async runtime.

## Usage

For code usage examples, see the [documentation](https://docs.rs/dbus-secret-service) and the [example program](https://github.com/open-source-cooperative/dbus-secret-service/blob/main/examples/example.rs).

This crate has no default features, and requires no features to run. If you want your secrets to be encrypted on their
way to and from the secret service (highly recommended), then add one of the crypto features:

* `crypto-rust` uses pure Rust crates for encryption.
* `crypto-openssl` uses the openssl libraries for encryption (which must be installed).

See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/dbus-secret-service) for details on how to connect to the Secret Service with an encrypted session.

To _build_ a project that uses this crate, your development machine will need to have the dbus development headers installed, and the openssl development headers for the `crypto-openssl` feature. To _run_ an application that uses this crate, your machine will need to have `libdbus` installed (almost all do), and the openssl libraries for the `crypto-openssl` feature. If you want to avoid this runtime requirement on clients, you can specify the `vendored` feature at build time: this will build and statically link the needed libraries with your executable.

### Functionality

* SecretService: initialize dbus, create plain or encrypted session connection.
* Collections: create, delete, search.
* Items: create, delete, search, get/set secret.
